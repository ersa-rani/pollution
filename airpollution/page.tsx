        pollution Credits Air pollution Overview Impact WHO response Air
        pollution is contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any
        chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the natural
        characteristics of the atmosphere. Household combustion devices, motor
        vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires are common sources of
        air pollution. Pollutants of major public health concern include
        particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur
        dioxide. Outdoor and indoor air pollution cause respiratory and other
        diseases and are important sources of morbidity and mortality. WHO data
        show that almost all of the global population (99%) breathe air that
        exceeds WHO guideline limits and contains high levels of pollutants,
        with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest
        exposures. Air quality is closely linked to the earth’s climate and
        ecosystems globally. Many of the drivers of air pollution (i.e.
        combustion of fossil fuels) are also sources of greenhouse gas
        emissions. Policies to reduce air pollution, therefore, offer a win-win
        strategy for both climate and health, lowering the burden of disease
        attributable to air pollution, as well as contributing to the near- and
        long-term mitigation of climate change.

        hanging over cities to smoke inside the home, air pollution poses a
        major threat to health and climate. Ambient (outdoor) air pollution in
        both cities and rural areas is causing fine particulate matter which
        result in strokes, heart diseases, lung cancer, acute and chronic
        respiratory diseases. Additionally, around 2.4 billion people are
        exposed to dangerous levels of household air pollution, while using
        polluting open fires or simple stoves for cooking fuelled by kerosene,
        biomass (wood, animal dung and crop waste) and coal. The combined
        effects of ambient air pollution and household air pollution is
        associated with 7 million premature deaths annually. Sources of air
        pollution are multiple and context specific. The major outdoor pollution
        sources include residential energy for cooking and heating, vehicles,
        power generation, agriculture/waste incineration, and industry. Policies
        and investments that support sustainable land use, cleaner household
        energy and transport, energy-efficient housing, power generation,
        industry, and better municipal waste management can effectively reduce
        key sources of ambient air pollution. Fact sheets Databases and tools

        WHO promotes interventions and initiatives for healthy sectoral policies
        (including energy, transport, housing, urban development and
        electrification of health-care facilities), addressing key risks to
        health from air pollution indoors and outdoors, and contributing to
        achieving health co-benefits from climate change mitigation policies.
        WHO provides technical support to WHO’s Member States in the development
        of normative guidance, tools and provision of authoritative advice on
        health issues related to air pollution and its sources. WHO monitors and
        reports on global trends and changes in health outcomes associated with
        actions taken to address air pollution at the national, regional and
        global levels. WHO has also developed and implemented a strategy for
        raising awareness on the risk of air pollution, as well as available
        solutions that can be implemented to mitigate the risks of exposure to
        air pollution. Through digital outreach and partnerships, WHO has helped
        enrich the value proposition of addressing air pollution for health and
        environment ministries, city governments and other stakeholders from
        sectors with significant emissions.
