        <b>land pollution,</b>
      </h1>
      the deposition of solid or liquid waste materials on land or underground
      in a manner that can contaminate the soil and groundwater, threaten public
      health, and cause unsightly conditions and nuisances. The waste materials
      that cause land pollution are broadly classified as municipal solid waste
      (MSW, also called municipal refuse), construction and demolition (C&D)
      waste or debris, and hazardous waste. MSW includes nonhazardous garbage,
      rubbish, and trash from homes, institutions (e.g., schools), commercial
      establishments, and industrial facilities. Garbage contains moist and
      decomposable (biodegradable) food wastes (e.g., meat and vegetable
      scraps); rubbish comprises mostly dry materials such as paper, glass,
      textiles, and plastic objects; and trash includes bulky waste materials
      and objects that are not collected routinely for disposal (e.g., discarded
      mattresses, appliances, pieces of furniture). C&D waste (or debris)
      includes wood and metal objects, wallboard, concrete rubble, asphalt, and
      other inert materials produced when structures are built, renovated, or
      demolished. Hazardous wastes include harmful and dangerous substances
      generated primarily as liquids but also as solids, sludges, or gases by
      various chemical manufacturing companies, petroleum refineries, paper
      mills, smelters, machine shops, dry cleaners, automobile repair shops, and
      many other industries or commercial facilities. In addition to improper
      disposal of MSW, C&D waste, and hazardous waste, contaminated effluent
      from subsurface sewage disposal (e.g., from septic tanks) can also be a
      cause of land pollution.

        <b>Solid-waste treatment and disposal</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Once collected, municipal solid waste may be treated in order to reduce
        the total volume and weight of material that requires final disposal.
        Treatment changes the form of the waste and makes it easier to handle.
        It can also serve to recover certain materials, as well as heat energy,
        for recycling or reuse.

       <h1 className="mainHeading"><b>Constructing the landfill</b></h1>  sanitary landfill sanitary landfillTwo methods
        of constructing a sanitary landfill. (The top and bottom liners and the
        leachate collection systems are not shown.) The basic element of a
        sanitary landfill is the refuse cell. This is a confined portion of the
        site in which refuse is spread and compacted in thin layers. Several
        layers may be compacted on top of one another to a maximum depth of
        about 3 metres (10 feet). The compacted refuse occupies about
        one-quarter of its original loose volume. At the end of each dayâ€™s
        operation, the refuse is covered with a layer of soil to eliminate
        windblown litter, odours, and insect or rodent problems. One refuse cell
        thus contains the daily volume of compacted refuse and soil cover.
        Several adjacent refuse cells make up a lift, and eventually a landfill
        may comprise two or more lifts stacked one on top of the other. The
        final cap for a completed landfill may also be covered with a layer of
        topsoil that can support vegetative growth. Daily cover soil may be
        available on-site, or it may be hauled in and stockpiled from off-site
        sources. Various types of heavy machinery, such as crawler tractors or
        rubber-tired dozers, are used to spread and compact the refuse and soil.
        Heavy steel-wheeled compactors may also be employed to achieve
        high-density compaction of the refuse. The area and depth of a new
        landfill are carefully staked out, and the base is prepared for
        construction of any required liner and leachate-collection system. Where
        a plastic liner is used, at least 30 cm (12 inches) of sand is carefully
        spread over it to provide protection from landfill vehicles. At sites
        where excavations can be made below grade, the trench method of
        construction may be followed. Where this is not feasible because of
        topography or groundwater conditions, the area method may be practiced,
        resulting in a mound or hill rising above the original ground. Since no
        ground is excavated in the area method, soil usually must be hauled to
        the site from some other location. Variations of the area method may be
        employed where a landfill site is located on sloping ground, in a
        valley, or in a ravine. The completed landfill eventually blends in with
        the landscape.
